The ping pong example is different from the other projects. 
This example contains two agents replying with "ping" and "pong" messages to eachother.

Run `node start.js` and fund the address shown in the QR code.
Next, run `node ping.js` and run `node pong.js` both in other terminals. 
Start the ping-pong process by running `node start.js ping`. 
Both agents will now reply to eachother.
